üöÄ Interview question: Mapping a Table Without a Primary Key in JPA

üîç Question:
I have a table with the following columns: employee name, salary, and department. However, the table doesn't have any primary key or constraints. How can I map this table to a JPA Entity class and a JPA repository?


---

üí° Answer:

In JPA, every entity needs a primary key. If your table doesn't have one, here are a few approaches to resolve this issue:

1. Use a Composite Key with @IdClass

If a combination of columns can serve as a unique identifier (e.g., a combination of employee name and department), you can use a composite key with the @IdClass annotation.

Example:

import java.io.Serializable;
import javax.persistence.*;

public class EmployeeId implements Serializable {
 private String name;
 private String department;
}

@Entity
@IdClass(EmployeeId.class)
public class Employee {
 @Id
 private String name;
 @Id
 private String department;
 private double salary;
}


---

2. Use an Artificial Key with @GeneratedValue

If you can modify the schema, add an artificial primary key (e.g., an auto-increment ID or UUID) to the table and map it with @GeneratedValue.

Example:

@Entity
public class Employee {
 @Id
 @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
 private Long id; // Auto-generated primary key

 private String name;
 private double salary;
 private String department;
}


---

3. Read-Only Entity

If the table is read-only and doesn't need to be modified, you can create a read-only entity with the @Immutable annotation and map it to your JPA entity class.

Example:

@Entity
@Immutable
public class Employee {
 @Id
 private String name; // Artificial identifier

 private double salary;
 private String department;
}


---

4. JPA Repository

Once you map the table to the entity, you can use the JPA Repository for basic CRUD operations.


public interface EmployeeRepository extends JpaRepository<Employee, EmployeeId> {
 // Custom queries can go here
}


---

üéØ Conclusion:

For composite keys: Use @IdClass.

For artificial keys: Add an auto-generated field.

For read-only tables: Use @Immutable.

üöÄ Scenario Based Interview Question: MicroservicesüöÄ

Imagine this scenario: You have three independent microservices‚ÄîService A, Service B, and Service C‚Äîthat process a request sequentially.

Service A receives the client request, processes it, and commits its transaction before passing it to Service B.

Service B does the same and then forwards the request to Service C.

Service C finalizes the process by committing its own transaction.

The twist? If any service fails (say, Service C), you need to roll back the transactions of all preceding services (Service A and Service B) to maintain overall system consistency. In other words, a failure in one service requires a cascading rollback across the entire workflow.

Interview Question: How would you design or enhance this system to ensure that a failure in any microservice triggers a rollback of all previous transactions?

Key points to consider:
Design Patterns: Would you leverage the Saga Pattern with compensating transactions, or opt for a distributed commit protocol like Two-Phase Commit?

Implementation Strategies: How can you ensure reliable execution of compensating actions, especially under partial failures or network issues?

Trade-offs: What are the performance implications and complexity trade-offs between different approaches?

Resilience: How would you monitor, log, and handle unforeseen failures during the rollback process?

This scenario challenges you to think about reliable distributed transaction management, balancing consistency, performance, and fault tolerance in a microservices architecture.
