Java Stream API: 3 Tips to Boost Your Stream Performance

The introduction of the Stream API and functional programming in Java 8 has revolutionized the way we handle iteration through the elements of a source, such as collections.

Here are three tips that may help you improve your stream processing performance.

1) Decrease Source Elements

Prioritize calls to methods like .filter(), .skip(), and .limit() as early as possible.
These operations are short-circuiting and reduce the number of elements processed downstream. Fewer elements lead to better performance.

2) Use Parallelism (Carefully)

Leveraging multiple processors can significantly improve performance, and the Stream API makes it easy to parallelize processing using .parallel().
By default, the stream runs on the common ForkJoinPool, but a custom pool can also be configured.

When using parallel streams, avoid stateful behavioral parameters, as they require locking and coordination between threads, which can undermine the benefits of parallelism.

3) Relax Order Constraint

Encounter order refers to the order in which elements are processed.
In parallel streams, preserving this order can negatively impact performance, especially for stateful operations like .distinct(), .skip(), and .limit().

If the order is not required, use .unordered() to relax ordering constraints and allow the stream to optimize element processing more freely.
