🚀 𝗠𝘆 𝗔𝗺𝗮𝘇𝗼𝗻 𝗦𝗗𝗘 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻 𝗣𝗿𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗝𝗼𝘂𝗿𝗻𝗲𝘆: 𝗢𝗻𝗲 𝗠𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗵.
Preparing for Amazon’s SDE Intern interview was an intense but rewarding journey. I had been consistently solving LeetCode since 2022, but after getting into UCF for my Master’s in November 2023, my coding practice took a backseat.

Fast forward to November 2024, I had just one month to get back in shape and prepare effectively. With limited time, I followed a structured and focused approach, making the most of the best resources available.

💡 𝗠𝘆 𝗣𝗿𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗦𝘁𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗴𝘆
✅ 𝗕𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗱 𝟳𝟱 & NeetCode 𝟭𝟱𝟬 – Quick refresher followed by deep pattern-based problem-solving (Huge thanks to NeetCode by NavDeep (Seek) Singh!)
✅ LeetCode 𝗣𝗿𝗲𝗺𝗶𝘂𝗺 (Amazon-𝗧𝗮𝗴𝗴𝗲𝗱 𝗤𝘂𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀) – Focused on the last 3 months' frequently asked problems to maximize efficiency.
✅ Amazon 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗱𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗵𝗶𝗽 𝗣𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗰𝗶𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘀 (𝗟𝗣𝘀) – Prepared 4-6 STAR stories, practiced mock interviews, and refined responses until they felt natural.
✅ 𝗚𝗿𝗮𝗽𝗵𝘀 & 𝗗𝗣 – takeUforward 𝗯𝘆 Raj Vikramaditya – Mastered BFS, DFS, Dijkstra’s, Floyd-Warshall, recursion + memoization.
✅ 𝗟𝗟𝗗 𝗕𝗮𝘀𝗶𝗰𝘀 – Ashish Pratap Singh – Focused on SOLID principles, OOP concepts, and common design patterns.
✅ 𝗠𝗼𝗰𝗸 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄𝘀 & 𝗣𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗲 – Simulated real interview conditions, practiced with friends, and fine-tuned problem explanations.

💡 𝗞𝗲𝘆 𝗧𝗮𝗸𝗲𝗮𝘄𝗮𝘆𝘀
🔹 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘀𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗻𝗰𝘆 > 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗻𝘀𝗶𝘁𝘆 – Even solving 2-3 problems a day makes a difference.
🔹 𝗥𝗲𝗰𝗼𝗴𝗻𝗶𝘇𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗣𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻𝘀 𝗶𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗚𝗮𝗺𝗲-𝗖𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗴𝗲𝗿 – It’s not about memorization; it’s about understanding problem-solving approaches.
🔹 𝗕𝗲𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗶𝗼𝗿𝗮𝗹 𝗥𝗼𝘂𝗻𝗱𝘀 𝗠𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿 – Amazon evaluates candidates on Leadership Principles, and a well-structured response makes a big difference.
🔹 𝗠𝗼𝗰𝗸 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄𝘀 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗘𝘀𝘀𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗮𝗹 – Talking through solutions improves clarity, confidence, and communication skills.

A big thanks to NavDeep (Seek) Singh (NeetCode), Raj Vikramaditya(takeUforward), and Ashish Pratap Singh for their incredible content that made my journey smoother!

**********

This software engineer joined Amazon as an SDE-2 after seven years of starting his career and accomplished his dream in 2025. From working as a freelancer to cracking Groww and Upstox to now Amazon… 

→ Background

\-- 7 years of experience 
\-- Decided to aim for FAANG in 2025.
\-- Cold-applied to Amazon. The recruiter replied within 24 hours.
\-- Offer: 40LPA+

→ OA & DSA Prep

\-- Cleared the online assessment (OA) easily. One of the Leetcode questions had already come up in prep; the other was straightforward.

\-- Key: Had already solved 700+ Leetcode questions. Held the 365-day streak badge.

\-- Practiced DSA every day for a year. “Every 100 problems, his skills leveled up.”

\-- If you’re prepping for interviews. I would recommend this DSA Pattern Sheet (https://bit.ly/45qggma)

→ Interview Loop: 4 Rounds

\-- Each round had 25–30 minutes of LP (Leadership Principles).
\-- Questions were pulled from the Amazon LP question bank (Google it).
\-- Technical rounds were a mix of coding, low-level/OOD, and system design.

→ Low-Level Design / OOD

\-- Example: Design a puppy shelter, focused on clean class design, method signatures, and writing a few simple functions to show approach.

→ System Design

\-- Example 1: Online library (think Ticketmaster).
\-- Example 2: Large data overlap problem, couldn’t fit into memory (pattern: LRU cache).
\-- Tip: Always clarify the question a lot before diving in. Sometimes, it's a classic problem in disguise.

→ Study Tips

\-- If you’re stuck, don’t waste hours reinventing the wheel. Look up the solution, learn the pattern, and move on.
\-- But if you recognize the approach, push yourself, try to solve it before peeking.

→ Top Resources Used

\-- DSA:
 • Neetcode
 • DSA Pattern Sheet – https://bit.ly/45qggma

\-- OOD:
 • Awesome Low-Level Design GitHub
 •Grokking the OOD Interview – designgurus

\-- System Design:
 • [System Design Primer GitHub]
 • [Grokking Modern System Design – educative]
 • [Alex Wu’s System Design Interview Vol. 1 & 2]
 • [Designing Data-Intensive Applications, Martin Kleppmann]

\-- Behavioral:
 • Dan Croitor YouTube
 • Amazon Interview Whizz
 • Jeff H Sipe PI Youtube 
 • Consolidated AIQB Reference Guide

→ Key Lessons
\-- Consistency trumps talent. Doing Leetcode for a year beats cramming Neetcode in a month.
\-- Quantity matters: every 100 problems = noticeable jump in skill.
\-- Habits compound: what you do daily shapes your success years from now.
