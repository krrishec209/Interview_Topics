🚀 𝗠𝘆 𝗔𝗺𝗮𝘇𝗼𝗻 𝗦𝗗𝗘 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻 𝗣𝗿𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗝𝗼𝘂𝗿𝗻𝗲𝘆: 𝗢𝗻𝗲 𝗠𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗵.
Preparing for Amazon’s SDE Intern interview was an intense but rewarding journey. I had been consistently solving LeetCode since 2022, but after getting into UCF for my Master’s in November 2023, my coding practice took a backseat.

Fast forward to November 2024, I had just one month to get back in shape and prepare effectively. With limited time, I followed a structured and focused approach, making the most of the best resources available.

💡 𝗠𝘆 𝗣𝗿𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗦𝘁𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗴𝘆
✅ 𝗕𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗱 𝟳𝟱 & NeetCode 𝟭𝟱𝟬 – Quick refresher followed by deep pattern-based problem-solving (Huge thanks to NeetCode by NavDeep (Seek) Singh!)
✅ LeetCode 𝗣𝗿𝗲𝗺𝗶𝘂𝗺 (Amazon-𝗧𝗮𝗴𝗴𝗲𝗱 𝗤𝘂𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀) – Focused on the last 3 months' frequently asked problems to maximize efficiency.
