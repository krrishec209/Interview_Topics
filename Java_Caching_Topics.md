As a Java developer, caching and performance are common interview topics. 


Make sure to read about these 20 key caching concepts before your interview 👇

1. Fundamentals of Caching: Types (In-Memory, Distributed, Persistent), Eviction Policies (LRU, LFU, FIFO, ARC)

2. Cache Invalidation Strategies: Write-Through, Write-Behind, Lazy Loading, TTL

3. Spring Boot Caching Basics (@ Cacheable, @ CachePut, @ CacheEvict) and Providers (Redis, Ehcache, Caffeine, Hazelcast)

4. Hibernate Caching Overview: First-Level vs. Second-Level Cache, Query Cache, and Their Use Cases

5. Handling Stale Data in Hibernate Cache Due to External DB Updates and Using Event Listeners for Cache Eviction

6. Redis Caching Basics: Key-Value Storage, Persistence (RDB, AOF), Expiry Policies

7. Redis Advanced Data Structures for Caching: Strings, Hashes, Lists, Sets, Sorted Sets

8. Redis Transactions and Pipelining: Optimizing Cache Writes

9. Redis Pub/Sub: Real-Time Messaging for Cache Invalidation Across Applications

10. Redis Cluster and Replication: Ensuring High Availability and Scalability

11. Redis Eviction Policies: LRU, LFU, Random, Noeviction Strategies

12. Redis LUA Scripting: Optimizing Batch Cache Operations

13. Redis Performance Optimization: Connection Pooling, Thread Tuning, Memory Optimization

14. Memcached vs. Redis: Key Differences and When to Use Each

15. Hazelcast and Apache Ignite: Distributed Caching, Near Cache, and In-Memory Data Grid Features

16. Cache Synchronization Across Microservices: Challenges and Solutions Using Redis

17. Implementing Cache Refresh Jobs to Handle Stale Data Automatically

18. Best Practices for Distributed Caching in Java: Avoiding Cache Stampede, Thundering Herd Problem

19. Optimizing Cache TTL: Balancing Performance and Data Freshness in Redis and Other Caches

20. Monitoring and Debugging Caches: Redis Insight, Micrometer, Prometheus, and Grafana
