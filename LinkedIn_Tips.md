I got 25+ interview calls and 4 job offers in 30 days using these LinkedIn tricks that nobody talks about.

This time i was not getting as many interview calls as i expected, then i utilised Linkedin tricks that anyone can use irrespective of their followers to get maximum interview calls 💯

𝟭. 𝗦𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗰𝗵 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗿𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁 𝗸𝗲𝘆𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗱𝘀.

Look up terms like:

"HR", "Recruiter", "Talent Acquisition", "People", "Talent Scout", "HRBP" — these are the folks who can get your resume in front of the right people.

𝟮. 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗲 “𝗣𝗲𝗼𝗽𝗹𝗲” 𝗳𝗶𝗹𝘁𝗲𝗿

Once you search, click on the "People" tab to narrow down results to individuals (not posts or jobs).

𝟯. 𝗙𝗶𝗹𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝗯𝘆 𝘁𝗮𝗿𝗴𝗲𝘁 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗻𝘆

Use the "Current Company" filter to only see employees from companies you want to work at.

𝟰. 𝗦𝗲𝘁 “𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀” 𝘁𝗼 𝟭𝘀𝘁, 𝟮𝗻𝗱, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝟯𝗿𝗱

This opens up your results — you don’t need to know someone to connect!

𝟱. 𝗦𝗲𝗻𝗱 𝗽𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘇𝗲𝗱 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗿𝗲𝗾𝘂𝗲𝘀𝘁𝘀

Short, respectful messages expressing your interest in their company or role make a difference. Mention what you're applying for — keep it authentic

𝟲. 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗼𝗻 𝗽𝗼𝘀𝘁𝘀 𝗳𝗿𝗼𝗺 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝘁𝗮𝗿𝗴𝗲𝘁 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗻𝗶𝗲𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗿𝗲𝗰𝗿𝘂𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀

Get noticed by being visible. Thoughtful comments > cold DMs.

𝟳. 𝗨𝘀𝗲 “𝗢𝗽𝗲𝗻 𝘁𝗼 𝗪𝗼𝗿𝗸” — 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝗰𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗶𝘇𝗲 𝗶𝘁

Don’t just turn it on — add job titles, locations, and employment types. LinkedIn promotes detailed profiles more.

𝟴. 𝗢𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗶𝘇𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗵𝗲𝗮𝗱𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗲

Go beyond your job title. Try:

"SDE-1 | Java | ReactJs | Scalable systems | DSA | Open to new opportunities"

𝟵. 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗷𝗼𝗯 𝗮𝗹𝗲𝗿𝘁𝘀 𝘀𝗺𝗮𝗿𝘁𝗹𝘆

Apply within the first 24 hours (The earlier the better), recruiters are most active when listings go live.

𝟭𝟬. 𝗥𝗲𝗮𝗰𝗵 𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘁𝗼 𝗽𝗲𝗼𝗽𝗹𝗲 𝘄𝗵𝗼 𝗿𝗲𝗰𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗹𝘆 𝗷𝗼𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗻𝘆

New hires often know what worked in the interview process and are more likely to respond. They can provide the HR number also whom you can directly reach out.

𝟭𝟭. 𝗣𝗼𝘀𝘁 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗼𝗻𝗰𝗲/𝘁𝘄𝗶𝗰𝗲 𝗮 𝘄𝗲𝗲𝗸 (𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗻 𝘀𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲 𝘀𝘁𝘂𝗳𝗳!)

Talk about your journey, learning, or job search. It gets you visibility.
