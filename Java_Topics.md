Why Constructor Injection is Better than Field Injection in Spring Boot

When I started with Spring Boot, I used @Autowired on fields — because it worked. But here’s what I learned-> 

1- Clear dependencies —->
Constructor injection lists all required dependencies in one place — the constructor. Easy to read, easy to understand.

2- Immutability —->
You can make fields final. No accidental changes. Safer code.

3- Test-friendly —->
Unit testing becomes easier. No need for Spring context or reflection to inject mocks.

4- Compile-time safety —->
Missing dependencies? Constructor injection fails at compile time — not in production with a NullPointerException.

5- Less Spring-coupled—->
Your code becomes more reusable outside Spring — no @Autowired everywhere.

💡 Bonus: Since Spring 4.3, you don’t even need @Autowired if there’s only one constructor.

@Service
public class UserService {
 private final UserRepository repo;

 public UserService(UserRepository repo) {
 this.repo = repo;
 }
}
—-

Field injections->

@Autowired
private UserRepository repo;
