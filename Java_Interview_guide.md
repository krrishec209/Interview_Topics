Interview Preparation Guide for Java, Spring Boot, and Microservices
Are you preparing for your next big interview? Whether youâ€™re aiming for Java, Spring Boot, or Microservices roles, having a structured roadmap is key. To help you ace it, Iâ€™ve put together an essential guide along with a handy PDF resource you can download for detailed prep!

â¸»

ðŸ“˜ Topics Covered in the PDF:
 â€¢ âœ… Java Core Concepts
 â€¢ âœ… Advanced Java Features (Java 8+)
 â€¢ âœ… Spring Boot Annotations & REST API Design
 â€¢ âœ… Microservices Principles and Tools
 â€¢ âœ… Database Integration, Security Basics, and More!

â¸»

â˜• Java Essentials

Mastering Java is fundamental. Be ready to tackle:
 â€¢ ðŸ”¹ Core Concepts: OOP principles like inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
 â€¢ ðŸ”¹ Java 8 Features: Streams, Lambdas, Optional, and functional interfaces.
 â€¢ ðŸ”¹ Data Structures & Algorithms: Collections framework, time complexities, and algorithm design.

â¸»

Spring Boot Mastery

Spring Boot powers modern REST APIs and microservices. Focus on:
 â€¢ ðŸ”¹ Key Annotations: @RestController, @Autowired, and their inner workings.
 â€¢ ðŸ”¹ REST API Design: Building and testing APIs with proper error handling.
 â€¢ ðŸ”¹ Database Integration: Master Spring Data JPA, relationships, and custom queries.
 â€¢ ðŸ”¹ Security Basics: JWT, role-based access, and Spring Security essentials.

â¸»

Microservices Concepts

Microservices are the backbone of scalable systems. Prep on:
 â€¢ ðŸ”¹ Architecture Principles: Service discovery, load balancing, and API gateways.
 â€¢ ðŸ”¹ Service Communication: REST vs. messaging (RabbitMQ, Kafka).
 â€¢ ðŸ”¹ Spring Cloud: Eureka, Gateway, and resilience patterns with Hystrix.
 â€¢ ðŸ”¹ Monitoring & Observability: Tools like Prometheus and Zipkin for tracing and metrics.

****************

I wish someone had given me this cheat sheet when I started interviewing for software engineering positions.

Topics covered: SOLID, ACID, System design key concepts & Leetcode patterns.

â–º SOLID Principles:

1. Single Responsibility: Each class should have only one job.
2. Open/Closed: Classes should be extendable without being modified.
3. Liskov Substitution: Subclasses should be replaceable with their parent classes.
4. Interface Segregation: Prefer small, specific interfaces over general ones.
5. Dependency Inversion: Rely on abstractions rather than specific implementations.


â–ºACID Properties:

1. Atomicity: Transactions are indivisible units; they either fully succeed or completely fail.
2. Consistency: Each transaction must maintain the database's consistency.
3. Isolation: Transactions should execute independently without affecting each other.
4. Durability: Once a transaction is finalized, it must persist even through system failures.
